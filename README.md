# Notification Demo

A demo to let me expore the notification API with a view to using it for web push notifications


## How to run
- Clone the [repository](https://github.com/Marcamillian/NotificationDemo)
- Serve the files from the directory (I like to use [live-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/live-server))
